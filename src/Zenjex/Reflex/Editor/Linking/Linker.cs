// IUnityLinkerProcessor / UnityEditor.UnityLinker was removed in Unity 6.
// The link.xml file is now referenced directly via the asmdef or placed in
// a Resources folder — no code-based linker processor is needed.
//
// If you need custom link.xml injection, use IPostBuildPlayerScriptDLLs
// or ship the file via package layout (Assets/…/link.xml auto-discovery).
